## Hosting

This template does not work properly on GitHub Pages. Use Netlify or Vercel instead (make sure to use the `npm run generate` command instead of `npm run build` there).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install --legacy-peer-deps 

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
